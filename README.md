## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SCSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- Prettier
- OOP
- Vite(yarn)

### What I learned

- RegEx
- Email validation

### Continued development

Email validation was definitely a difficult task. Not to mention, responsive design is no joke either.

### Useful resources
